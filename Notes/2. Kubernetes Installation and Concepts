Kubernetes 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#pod-v1-core)
Different ways to learn :
Docker Desktop => provide kubectl out of the box + reesources used by docker running on your hardware and kbs can be shared and much lighter to work with
Minikube on your local hardware
Microk8s on virtual machine on linux env  
katacoda.com on your browser

We will use Docker Desktop which provides virtual machine needed for the minikube. We will install kubectl which is kbs CLI. Also we will install minikube which is single node kubernetes cluster based out of your local hardware.
